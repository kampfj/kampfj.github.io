A journey with a new read always starts the moment I lay eyes on the front cover. It’s a moment of truth: wading through hundreds of titles at *Book Traders* in Memphis, Tennessee, each author and cover artist has slightly less than a tenth of a second to convince me to pick up their piece. Once I hold the book in my hands for the first time, perhaps more of a fair trial proceeds: flipping through pages and reading synopses and reviews—while not a foolproof algorithm—offers a more comprehensive lens into an author’s style and general reception. 

But the real game is provoking the initial reach. And, in line with most of Western consumership, my favor is usually won or lost in the first instant. 

I suspect Bill O’Reilly knows this game, because his *Killing Lincoln* stands as one of the strangest book covers I’ve ever seen: if I hadn’t been aware that Abraham Lincoln was the fifteenth President of the United States—one of the most influential and talked-about political figures, assassinated before his time—I may be fooled into thinking that a man named Killing Lincoln had written a story entitled *Bill O’Reilly* (with “ & Martin Dugard” in much, much smaller text below. So maybe Martin contributed or maybe he didn’t, I couldn’t really tell). Never before had I seen a book where the author’s name stood starkly more prominent than the title of the book itself. 

Starved for a scintillating account of one of the first ever Presidential assassinations, and a little more eager to learn more about the subtleties of Lincoln’s character, I concede to O’Reilly. I buy the book and go home.

I’d be lying to you if I told you I didn’t enjoy reading this book. I appreciated O’Reilly’s (or Dugard’s…?) unique handle of prose, especially on the battlefield. O’Reilly’s usage of an omnipresent narrator allows the book to read much more like a thriller than a pure historical account. However, O’Reilly’s characters—particularly Lincoln—too much resemble cut-and-paste archetypes to completely capture their complexity.

## Men at War 
The book does an excellent job achieving one of the most challenging tasks inherent in historical analysis: synthesis. Though the main topic is Lincoln’s assassination, O’Reilly frames the story around something much larger than that: a fractured America, post-Civil War and pre-Reconstruction. The message this sends to the reader is a valuable one: you can’t possibly begin to understand Lincoln’s assassination unless you understand the deep-rooted political circumstances that surrounded it. 

O’Reilly’s shining moments come in his vivid descriptions of Civil War battles. By highlighting the humanity of war and the intense emotional feelings it wrought onto its participants, O’Reilly sets the stage for the type of radical motivations necessary for an assassination of the magnitude that John Wilkes Booth carried out against Lincoln. In accomplishing this, O’Reilly effectively combines second-hand description with primary sources: 

> Making matters worse is the very real fear of Union troops launching a surprise attack. “The nervousness,” a Confederate major will remember, “resulting from this constant strain of starvation, fatigue and lack of sleep was a dangerous thing, sometimes producing lamentable results.” On several occasions bewildered Confederate troops open fire on one another, thinking they’re firing at Yankees. (O’Reilly, 33) 

Despite these terrible circumstances, or perhaps *because* of them, a dangerous strain of loyalty and brotherhood develops among the troops, symbolic of how truly divided the North and the South were at the time. 

> “My shoes are gone,” a veteran soldier laments during the march. “My clothes are almost gone. I’m weary, I’m sick, I’m hungry...I would die, yes I would die willingly, because I love my country. But if this war is ever over, I’ll be damned if I ever love another country.” (O’Reilly, 47) 

These brief and clear moments of humanity amidst the chaos of war bring to light the passion that war breeds - more specifically, a burning passion of hate between the Union and Confederate soldiers. Developing this storyline is key to establishing the political backdrop for Lincoln’s assassination and the motivations behind it. 

## The All-Knowing 
I often wonder why it’s hard for me to keep up consistently with the daily news. Why is it that I would willingly pay money to delve into a historical account like this one, yet I neglect to fully take advantage of the wealth of information that floods my phone daily? 

I’ve recently come to the conclusion that this dichotomy can be largely explained by the prominence of narrative in human understanding. The pure flood of media content that comes all of our way in the form of tweets, GIFs, and short clips seems like an undifferentiated blob of everything and nothing at the same time. Sure, there’s a lot of content - but it’s so all over the place and there’s so much of it that it’s nearly impossible to make sense of in real time. 

O’Reilly has the privilege of having, nearly two centuries after the fact, an aerial view of the wide range of events leading up to Lincoln’s 1863 assassination. He takes full advantage of this by synthesizing war, love, culture, and politics into a singular compelling narrative. By framing all of the story’s events around the assassination—despite the fact that some of them seem to have nothing to do with the killing at the time—O’Reilly creates a bond with the reader. You know that connection that’s created when you tell a friend something you’ve never told anybody else? As soon as I started *Killing Lincoln*, I entered a new world full of loyal Union generals, Confederate rebels, White House staff, and famous actors and actresses. Yet, O’Reilly and myself are the only ones in on the secret: 

> Then Lincoln walks back up to the top deck of the *River Queen* and stares off into the distance...It is April 2, 1865. The man with thirteen days left on earth is pacing. (O’Reilly, 12)

## There’s More than Meets the Eye 
Growing up, I always thought Abraham Lincoln was nothing more than an American savior. Like, nothing more. This man ended the Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, all while deliberately picking up the pieces of a fragmented nation. And presumably, this is what consumed his life, all day and every day: the pursuit of a united and equal nation. That was Abraham Lincoln.

Rarely, though, is it that simple. While it’s heartwarming to think that President Lincoln tried to end slavery purely because he had a deep, warm belief in the equality of all beings, it would be intellectually dishonest to ignore the evidence that Lincoln had less humanitarian and perhaps more economic ends in mind. 

For example, as an Illinois lawyer, Lincoln represented clients on both sides of the slavery issue, even once arguing once for a [Kentucky slaveholder trying to reclaim his property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matson_Trial). Even his words during the Lincoln-Douglas debates, which went a long way toward granting Lincoln his lauded nickname of “The Great Emancipator”, might surprise you:

> I will say that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races...and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. (Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Debate IV)

I bring all of this just to establish that Lincoln’s beliefs seem to have more layers and complexity than what is generally taught in elementary schools and spoken about in general conversation today. I found that *Killing Lincoln*, however, portrays Lincoln as the archetypal heroic figure. And nothing more, really. 

> Lincoln’s youth has aged into a landscape of fissures...Lincoln’s strength, however, is still there, manifested in his passionate belief that the nation must and can be healed. He alone has the power to get it done...He is a man of faith. God will guide him one way or another. (O’Reilly, 11-12) 

> He is a politician, and politicians are seldom given the chance to play the role of conquering hero. (O’Reilly, 40)

> Every aspect of Lincoln’s early morning has the feel of a man putting his affairs in order: reading the Bible, jotting a few notes, arranging for a last carefree whirl around Washington with his loyal wife, and setting his son on a path that will ensure him a successful future. All of this is done unconsciously, of course, but it is notable. (O’Reilly, 146)

Maybe Lincoln was just *that* straightforward of a guy, but I doubt it. Even from a cursory web search one can start to find insight into the complexity of his views on slavery, race, and more. Yet, all we get here is a tall man who is supremely confident in his leadership abilities, stands certain about every decision, brings the United States through the most tumultuous internal divide in our history, leads a perfect family life, and eats cold hard-boiled eggs in the morning without blinking an eye. 

His wife, Mary, is portrayed as mostly a nuisance, “whose intellect does not match her considerable capacity for rage” (O’Reilly, 154). Mary is starved for affection that Lincoln just doesn’t really have the time or energy to give:

> He has freed the slaves. This is a man who has the power to do almost anything he wants. And tonight, if truth be told, he would prefer to see *Aladdin*. Yet Lincoln would never dream of contradicting Mary’s wishes. His life is much easier when she is appeased...Mary’s rants...can sidetrack Lincoln’s day and drain him of precious energy, so he does all he can to make sure nothing upsets her unstable psyche. (O’Reilly, 154)

In no way can one critique O’Reilly for the nature of Abe and Mary’s relationship issues -- his job is to relay the history, whatever that may be. I was more struck by the nature of the relationship itself, because I just think it’s worth noting. 

With all that being said, I would have loved to see deeper character development from O’Reilly and less of a reliance on the obviously alluring assassination plotline itself. In fact, I think getting more complex about the Lincolns would have made the assassination plot more compelling for the reader. 

Overall, I learned a ton from the book. When trying to piece together a fact-based thriller like this, it’s important to be conscious of the fuzzy line between historical retelling and revisionist history. For the most part, I really appreciated the way O’Reilly handled this balance.
