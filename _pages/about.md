I'm a **dual major in Computer Science and Philosophy** at the University of Pennsylvania's [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://admissions.upenn.edu/learning-at-penn/undergraduate-schools/penn-engineering).

Sometimes, I like to hang out with [Russell Charnoff](https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/liherald/original/1413985560_600f.jpg).

This website was created as a personal project using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), HTML, and CSS.
