Kevin Parker is in a different zone.  

"Lost in Yesterday" is the eighth track off of Tame Impala's newly released 2020 album, *The Slow Rush*. While Parker leaves more room than ever to interpret with this record as a whole, "Lost in Yesterday" specifically leaves little to chance. Parker mulls over the mysterious movement of time and the blurred lines between reality and memory - in a large way, this theme embodies the entire album. The loaded tracklist is sandwiched by "One More Year" and "One More Hour", with "Tomorrow's Dust" right in between. To truly analyze Parker's intention, which seems to be to convey his idea of the cyclic nature of time and the prominence of our past on our present state of mind, it's crucial to watch the music video for "Lost in Yesterday":

> When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?  
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven  
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one  
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones  

> So if they call you, embrace them  
If they hold you, erase them  

> 'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?  
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?  
And you might've missed somethin', don't say  
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday  
And you're gonna have to let it go someday  
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day  
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say  
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday  

> Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it  
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy, I demand it  
So, what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?  
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"  

> 'Cause if they call you, embrace them  
If they stall you, erase them   

> 'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?  
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?   
And you might've missed somethin', don't say  
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday  
And you're gonna have to let it go someday  
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day  
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say  
'Cause it has to get lost in yesterday  

> If it calls you, embrace it  
If it haunts you, face it  

> I know it's mad, I understand  
It's only Snakes and Ladders  
The period you never had  
There's only one that matters  

> And if it calls you, embrace it  
If it holds you, erase it  
Replace it  

One of the things I love about Parker is that he's a true solo act. Every last sonic synth, hypnotic electric thump, and light vocal is his brainchild - as a result, his music videos are purposeful. They're filled with intention and nuanced detail. It's very rare that I can get the entire meaning of a song simply from the panning pattern of the camera on the music video, but watch closely. Notice that throughout the song, the camera moves in a circle. It moves slowly, but surely. And as it moves in circles, it captures a single event seen through the ever-shifting lenses of time passed. A young bride and groom, looking less than jubilant, cut an undersized wedding cake as their family and friends look on with little interest. But the scene gradually changes. Plaid, short-sleeved button down shirts become clean suits. Cold cuts and crackers turn to fancy fruit platters and dips on the buffet as the dull, auburn bouqet blooms into bright, white and yellow daisies. Small and petty familial feuds slowly dissolve as a contagious air of celebration washes over everyone at the wedding. 

The only constant seems to be Parker as he performs on the stage, but even the man himself isn't immune to the passage of time - he is first pictured in a modest striped button-down, backed by a bare boombox and a less-than-enthused drummer who looks like he'd rather be anywhere else than doing a lazy, low-paying gig with a no-name like Kevin. A minute later, Parker and Co. - draped by a flashy arrangement of lights - have suddently added a swaggering guitarist and somehow managed to find matching yellow turtlenecks. Eighty seconds pass before we see Parker again. This time, our drummer has lost eighty pounds and upgraded his set to include a booming bass, complemented by a young man on the keyboard and yet another guitarist. At this point, the yellow turtlenecks have been upgraded to yellow tuxedos. Still matching. 

In some ways, it seems like Parker also sends a message with this video about his own career and ascendance to celebrity. At the beginning of the video, he was "livin' in Squalor", hustling by himself to try to make a living in a tough world. As his music grew more popular, his clothes got more expensive. He added new people to his inner circle other than the trusty but rusty and reliable drummer. But is this life really better? Parker is self-admittedly delusional, writing with a troubling self-awareness that "eventually terrible memories turn into great ones". In other words, Parker knows how much he despised the grind. He knows what it took to get up early in the AM and drive from bar to bar trying to make a name for himself and his music. But in some ways, when you do make it - Parker muses - you end up wondering why you didn't enjoy the process of getting there more than you actually did.

I mean, the name of the album is *The Slow Rush*. That, in itself, is a contradiction in reference to time - and I think it's Parker's way of showing his hand to his audience. Ultimately, what Tame tries to get across with this track is the idea that, in the moment, things might be uninteresting. Dull. Slow, As time brings us further from an experience, it becomes a rush in our minds. A blur of excitement. 

There's nothing uninteresting about this piece and this entire record. I strongly encourage a full listen, preferably in one sitting and from Track 1 to 12 in the original order. 

"Nostalgia is a drug, to which some are addicted" - Kevin Parker.
