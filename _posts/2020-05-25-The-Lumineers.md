title: "Historical Allusions in the Lumineers' Debut Album"
categories: music_post

Rich piano ballads and airy acoustic riffs color the Lumineers’ self-titled debut album, but Wesley Schultz and Jeremiah Fraites’ first studio piece goes well beyond aesthetics. The album’s youthful, independence-seeking anti-war redolence shines through with twentieth-century historical allusions and political imagery throughout the tracklist. If I were to sum up *The Lumineers* (the self-titled album, not to be confused with the band) in one photo, it would probably look something like this:

This photo of a young couple speaking their last words before the husband is taken by the draft may evoke feelings of love, youthfulness, and independence. But it also reminds us of the realities that make these values so difficult to maintain. I want to explore in detail the historical references throughout the album that bring alive the themes of *The Lumineers*. 

## The Pull of Service and the Tug of Freedom
Few mainstream artists incorporate such political themes of patriotism, sacrifice, and freedom in their music like the Lumineers do - perhaps that’s because few mainstream artists have comparably strong emotional ties to these ideas. Wesley Schultz, the 37-year-old lead singer and guitarist for the group, speaks from the heart in “Charlie Boy”, telling the story of his uncle who died in US military service in the Vietnam War. The mellow, full violin that cries quietly behind Wesley’s croons symbolizes the futility of war as Schultz describes his personal and familial grief. By describing a seemingly senseless death in such graphic detail, “Charlie Boy” implicitly references the broad social movement through the 60s and 70s which protested US involvement in Vietnam.  

But “Charlie Boy” also suggests that Wesley’s uncle was moved to serve for his country based on his deep American patriotism and John F. Kennedy’s inspiring rhetoric. As Wesley sings: “Kennedy made him believe / we could do much more.” More generally, this sentiment of American pride and admiration for JFK is echoed throughout the record. In a very subtle reference, “Classy Girls”, the second song on the album, describes a young man trying to pick up a date at a bar in the twentieth century. 

> I showed her my half-dollar ring  
> she said, “That’s pretty cool.” 

Just listening to the track casually, one probably wouldn’t pick up the reference to John F. Kennedy. After doing some research, however, I found that [half-dollar rings](https://www.coinjewelryco.com/products/1971-2017-jfk-half-dollar-coin-ring-hand-made-usa-sizes-8-5-to-15) are collectors’ pieces of jewelry composed purely of half-dollar coins, one of the newest pieces of US currency bearing JFK's likeness on its silver face. The protagonist of “Classy Girls” is clearly one who loves his country and Kennedy, and it’s hard to deny the connection between references to Vietnam in “Charlie Boy” and allusions to JFK throughout the album. After all, Kennedy's presidency coincided with the Vietnam War, and it was during this time that the seeds of protest against US involvement began. This tension between anti-war sentiment and admiration for Kennedy is highlighted in “Big Parade”, which is seemingly an ode to the presidential candidate and the chivalry that accompanies his presence in the town square. The rhythmic claps that introduce “Big Parade” sound like marching - they evoke a sense of obedience, order, and pride that perhaps underlie Charlie's motivations to serve his country and contribute on the front lines.

## Disillusionment with Hierarchy and Status Quo 
While *The Lumineers* is a story of young American pride, it’s also one of rebellion and revolution. In line with anti-war sentiment, “Submarines” is a deeply political, even seemingly Populist piece that tells the story of a young man who spots a Japanese submarine in Baldwin Bay, New York. In the third track on the album, this unnamed man tries to warn everyone that an attack may be coming, but nobody listens. They write him off, as Wesley artfully describes:
 
> In the end, it boils down to credibility  
> I have none, so I will die  
> With the secrets of the sea 

The Lumineers here pose a critique to society and the powerlessness of the common man - regardless of the conviction this man has his information can save lives, his meek societal status prevents his word from being taken seriously. 

At the same time, Schultz and Fraites here employ a powerful literary device: “I will die / with the secrets of the sea” is perhaps an allusion to the naval warfare that has been waged overseas throughout American history. This line pays its respects to “secrets of the sea”, courageous young men and women who died protecting their countries. “I did spy periscopes” is also a neat literary move: a periscope is an instrument for observation and surveillance often used by underwater vessels - it allows you to see up and over the water. You see what they did there with “spy”? This is just one example of the literary nuances that make the Lumineers so special. 

But this is also an album about love, and the juxtaposition of “Dead Sea” coming right after “Submarines” in the tracklist perhaps goes deeper than simply continuing a nautical theme. A ballad of the love and support between two individuals, Wesley cries out “You’ll never sink when you are with me” immediately following his “Submarines” proclamation that “I will die with the secrets of the sea". The linguistic parallels and contrasts between these lines assure us that the support of a loved one may be able to carry us through the frustration of not being heard or given a voice.

“Dead Sea” similarly tells the story of two rebels fighting societal norms:

> You told me you were good at running away   
> Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase   

The Lumineers here allude to the downfall of “domestic life”, and the feminist movement that gained signficant strength in the twentieth century with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 and the strong voice of activists like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. This reference is backed strongly by “Flapper Girl”, the eighth song on the album. "Flapper Girl" beautifully tells the story of flappers, a generation of women in the 1920s who “rebelled” with non-traditional hairstyles and behavior that violated prevalent gender norms of the time. Flappers were icons of the Roaring Twenties, and symbolized a departure from feminine “domestic life” and traditional Victorian gender notions as more women began to embrace the workplace and their political efficacy. 

This album is rich with historical references and allusions - sometimes it takes some close reading and research to uncover their true depth. Slowly listening and reading the lyrics of these songs helps to extract these messages and appreciate the art of the Lumineers in its fullness.
