["The Perfect Space"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE-KqlFt5QI) is the fifth song off of the Avett Brothers' seventh studio album, **I and Love and You**.  

## Lyrics 

> I wanna have friends that I can trust,  
that love me for the man I've become not the man I was.  
I wanna have friends that will let me be  
all alone when being alone is all that I need.  

> I wanna fit in to the perfect space,  
feel natural and safe in a volatile place.  
And I wanna grow old without the pain,  
give my body back to the earth and not complain.  
Will you understand when I am too old of a man?  
And will you forget when we have paid our debt  
who did we borrow from? Who did we borrow from?  

> Okay part two now clear the house.  
The party's over take the shouting and the people,  
get out!  

> I have some business and a promise that I have to hold to.  
I do not care what you assume or what the people told you.  
Will you understand, when I am too old of a man?  
Will you forget when we have paid our debts,  
who did we borrow from? Who did borrow from?  

> I wanna have pride like my mother has,  
And not like the kind in the bible that turns you bad.  
And I wanna have friends that I can trust,  
that love me for the man I've become and not the man that I was.  


## An Interpretation 

In their 2009 track “The Perfect Space”, the Avett Brothers use repetition, pace, perspective, and allusion as they meditate on the temporary nature of man’s place in this world. As usual, Scott and Seth here convey a resonant, humbling, and spiritual message.  

Often, the two most important moments in a song are the opening and closing lines. The artist wants to both introduce the listener to a theme as well as leave him/her with a final impression of the message. The Brothers leave nothing to chance, conveniently repeating the same line to bookend the track: 

> “I wanna have friends that I can trust, that love me for the man I’ve become and not the man that I was.” 

Buried in this layered line is an allusion to “Open-Ended Life” - the opening track to the Avett Brothers’ 2013 album, **Magpie and the Dandelion**. Wrapping the song with this line clues us in to the nature of what the Brothers’ mean when they reference this theoretical “perfect space” that titles the song: one should evolve, with ideas and attitudes fluid. When one occupies this space, they proactively learn and continually sharpen their thought processes about the world around them. 

This repetition suggests that achieving this fluid lifestyle can be much easier when you're surrounded by friends and family who are sensitive to your struggle. Each day, one inhabits *“the man I’ve become,”* while yester-you is *“the man that I was.”* The Avett Brothers wonder: If someone can’t come to terms with your constant evolution and change, are they even worth keeping around? Sometimes having this open-ended lifestyle can have consequences, and the Avett Brothers realize that turnover in their inner circle has to be one of them, as some people just can't accept the changes that you make in your life. 

I can’t help but notice an additional qualifier in the form of the repetitive “wanna” that permeates the track. We all want to optimize our time here and fly to this market-driven destination of happiness that is too often just out of our reach. But perhaps the perfect space is unattainable. Perhaps the pursuit of such an end is even foolish - at times, it almost sounds like this track is a satirical jab aimed at a society which glamorizes this perfect and oft-superficial life. The Brothers almost sarcastically wish to *“grow old without the pain”*…they realize that there’s a certain submission to nature that’s required for one to have peace in this world - to realize that though we “wanna” do so many things, we’re only here for a short time. They wonder: maybe it’s just better to *“give my body back to the earth and not complain...”*

But they take it even further. The Avett Brothers are trying to sensitize us to a necessary balance of both personal responsibility and order as well as submission to the inevitable chaos that accompanies life. 

This dialectic is concretized with the pace of the song. The melody in the verse remains both constant and soothing, serial and symmetric. Everything’s chill. 

And then the drums kick in. And it’s chaos. 

My instict is that this is more than just a play on the balance of order and chaos that we all feel in our lives. There’s a change in perspective that also happens here - a sensitive ear and eye to these carefully-crafted lyrics should confirm this idea. As the Brothers' wish for this “perfect space”, they also start to realize that not only is it unattainable, but that they are eternally indebted to the power that put them in this world. They starts to wonder — *“Who did we borrow from? Who did we borrow from?”* — we “wanna” do all these things, but we’re just passing through this world at the mercy of something bigger. Be this an actual deity or a more general idea/principle is unclear from the lyrics, but it's definitely there. 

And then the drums kick in.  

*“The party’s over. Take the shouting and the people. GET OUT!”*  

Just like that, the temporality of man is exposed and his petty idea of a “perfect space” thrashed. This world doesn’t *“care what you assume and what the people told you.”* Whatever this Supreme Being or idea is, they have their own business to take care of. 

Now, the spiritual undertone of this track comes into even clearer focus when the artist alludes to his quest for pride, with one qualifier: *“not like the kind in the Bible that turns you bad.”* The Bible is rife with stories of characters who struggled with this balance of personal accountability and acknowledgement of an unattainable natural power - think Balaam, who tried to take life into his own hands by cursing the Israelites before realizing that his fragile place in the world rendered him incapable of accomplishing the task. But the Brothers’ understand this balance, and they muse on the fact that humanity isn’t the full story of this world. 

But while we’re here, the Brothers tell us, don’t get it twisted: live an open-ended life. Surround yourself with those you love, develop your own unique thoughts about this world, and understand that putting yourself into as “perfect” a space as possible can be as simple as taking an active role in your life while internalizing the liberating idea that in the big picture, we have only limited time and agency.
