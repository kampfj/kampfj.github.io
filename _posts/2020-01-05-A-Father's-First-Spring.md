["A Father's First Spring"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sncq9hZg9AQ) is the ninth track off of the Avett Brothers' 2012 album, **The Carpenter**.  

## Lyrics 
> The sweetest surrender of winter, 
She put up her flag it is waving. 
The thunder of summer is rumbling in. 

> And I haven’t seen you in days, 
And my how that feeling has changed. 
Oh, I have been homesick for you since we met, 
I have been homesick for you.

> I’ve got to take to the sky, 
And I’ll tell you what that means for you and I - 
If I die, it’s for you. 
If I die it’s for you. 

> I never lived till I lived in your light, 
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight 
Of you baby blue God blessed your life, 
I do not live less I live in your light, 
I do not live less I live in your light. 

> The realest thing I ever felt
Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell.  I was a child before, 
The day that I met Elinor. 

> The kiss of the wind in the hills, 
The clearness of morning the late evening thrill. 
Blurry and gray like the road, 
The wheels on the highway above them I soared. 

> When I’m in the sweet daughter’s eyes, 
My heart is now ruined for the rest of all time.
There’s no part of it left to give. 
There’s no part of it left to give. 

> I never lived till I lived in your light, 
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight 
Of you baby blue God blessed your life, 
I do not live less I live in your light, 
I do not live less I live in your light. 
I do not live….


## An Interpretation 

Before diving into the song itself, it’s important to understand the Brothers’ family situations to give us context for the track. Scott is married with two children, living in North Carolina. Judging by the centrality of his family in the May It Last film combined with the familial lyrics of the group, it’s fair to say that both of the brothers are family men. Seth, however, has been divorced - an issue which he is unafraid to address head-on. Divorce Separation Blues from May It Last (album) offers a sensitive window into how Seth dealt with the split, and he often talks publicly about the importance of opening up about divorce and erasing the stigma that surrounds it. 

Fittingly, the seasoned Avett listener will quickly pick up on the fact that Scott is the vocalist on this track - considering the fact that he is the only Avett with a child, it’s almost impossible not to conclude that he was also the one who wrote it. A Father’s First Spring is a strikingly profound account of the transition from young adult to parent. If the listener wasn’t sure about the intent of the song, he/she need not look any further that the title of the song itself. 

Much of the profundity concealed in Avett lyrics can be uncovered by a common refrain - carefully examine their lyrics, and often there’s a line that repeats itself throughout the piece. Here, Scott lets us in to the importance of his newborn in his life by continually repeating

> I do not live ‘less I live in your light. 

In plain words, Scott’s child has become his lifeblood. It’s fascinating that he uses this word “light” to describe the joy and the overall feeling his child brings to his world, because upon further investigation we find this theme of “light” throughout the rest of the piece. 

This is where the first paragraph comes into play: 

> The sweetest surrender of winter, 
She put up her flag it is waving. 
The thunder of summer is rumbling in. 

I often say that one of the Avetts’ most special songwriting gifts (and they have many) is their unique ability to play with nature and the seasons. Their vivid imagery and convincing uses of personification bring their lyrics to life in a pretty special way, and this is just one example. 

I actually have two interpretations of verse one, each that lend themselves to alternate interpretations of the song overall. 

## Interpretation 1 

The verse is using the seasons to describe Scott’s wife’s pregnancy, likening Scott’s newborn to “summer” which “thunders” and “rumbles” into the world as the hold of science and pregnancy (winter) surrender to a child that is ready to burst out. Though this is a more far-fetched reading, I think it bodes nicely for Scott’s repetition of “light” and his description of his daughter as bringing everlasting warmth into his life. This is employed as a stark contrast to the cold and unwelcoming winter and ultimately any cold or unwelcoming sentiments that will ultimately wave their collective flags and surrender the love and kindness that this newborn will bring to the family. 

## Interpretation 2 

According to my second interpretation, this first verse is not referring to the actual birth of Scott’s child at all. Instead, it’s written after the child has already been born and Scott is returning home after long months on the road. Typically, the Avett Brothers’ tour during the winter, especially abroad, and they often get some time off during the summer to be with their families. Scott misses his daughter as well as his entire family, and feels like he is missing a part of himself on the road. That’s why the surrender of winter is so incredibly “sweet”. It means that Scott will soon be back and able to bask in the light of his daughter and the joy of being a parent. 

My second interpretation holds up much stronger with the rest of the song. In the next verse, Scott longs to be with his child: 

> And I haven’t seen you in days, 
And my how that feeling has changed. 
Oh, I have been homesick for you since we met, 
I have been homesick for you.

What feeling has changed? To me, Scott here describes the effect of the previous line, i.e. the effect of being away from his daughter for so long. It’s terrible. The feeling of comfort and love that he feels back home is altered by time on the road and weeks of seeing his daughter only through pictures. How can you capture the feeling of that priceless family time? What I think is even more fascinating about this verse is how Scott describes his homesickness from his daughter as having lasted “since we met.” This is the familial touch of the Brothers’ coming in at full force - very few dads, I imagine, would talk about uniting with their child for the first time in these terms. But to Scott, his daughter is his old friends. His best friend, who he “met” at her birth just like he meets the other people he cares about in his life. These are the lyrics that get the listener thinking and put a really soft touch on these songs that’s nothing short of special. 

Finally, Scott takes us back to what it was like to meet his daughter. Every time I listen to A Father’s First Spring, I am once again struck by the imagery of these stanzas. Why are they so vivid? Well, Scott lets us know that the birth of his first daughter was the “realest thing I ever felt” - the authenticity of the Brothers leaves them no choice but to try to relay this experience to their fans in as “real” a way as they can. Scott spares no details, describing the “blood on the floor and the love in your yell”. I think Scott is trying to convey how special his daughter is - that throughout the blood of childbirth and the pain involved, she came into the world with love. And realizing this, in the moment where he sees his own child for the first time, is what causes Scott Avett to grow up. In his words: 

> I was a child before, the day that I met Elinor. 

From a musical perspective, what happens next is extremely revealing. Scott stops singing, and a stunning acoustic ballad comes into earshot. About fifteen seconds of beautiful music as Scott takes in the moment of becoming a father for the first time and admires his newborn child. 

Driving back from the hospital, Scott has a new lens through which he views the world, one of appreciation and almost pure joy:

> The kiss of the wind in the hills, 
The clearness of morning the late evening thrill. 
Blurry and gray like the road, 
The wheels on the highway above them I soared. 

Even though the “road“ of life may be “blurry and gray” at times and we may be unclear of our direction, Scott’s perspective has been shifted. He sees the wind in the hills clearly and the morning is crisp. He soars above the road in his happiness and revels in the joy of caring for another human life as well as his own. Finally, he describes his overflowing love for his daughter by sarcastically remarking that his heart has been fully taken by her, and “there’s no part of it left to give“. I personally found this to be a pretty satisfying and endearing characterization, as we are all well-aware of the fact that the capacity for love in one’s heart is not capped by some finite number. To Scott, however, he can’t imagine loving someone as much as he loves his daughter, and even the simplest medical facts become blurred in his mind by his overwhelming feelings. 

When I listen to this song, I smile at Scott’s admirable ability to be vulnerable and to articulate emotions that most people cannot even begin to describe. This piece challenges me to fully appreciate the bond of family. At the end of the day, this is what the Avett Brothers do so well - through open, honest lyrics and beautiful melodies, they make us better people and expand our capacity to love and to give. This is an extremely personal and intimate piece, and I hope you enjoy and take as much from it as I do.
