Ever since I was a child, I've loved reading. Fictional series like *Percy Jackson* and *Harry Potter* could keep my attention for hours at a time. During high school and my gap year at Yeshivat Orayta in Jerusalem, Israel, I began to find a deeper appreciation for non-fiction literature. I also found freewriting and getting my thoughts down on paper after reading to be an enjoyable activity and one that would help me retain information and gain the most out of [my books](/book_list/). These posts will feature these thoughts. 

I'm always looking for new books to read - reach out with any suggestions!
