Music is a daily constant in my life. These five artists, in order, challenge my worldview and offer me guidance through their insightful lyrics:

1. [The Avett Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avett_Brothers)
2. [The Head and the Heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Head_and_the_Heart)
3. [The Lumineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lumineers)
4. [Tame Impala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Impala)
5. [twenty one pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots)

These posts will feature my thoughts on and intepretations of the lyrics of these artists and more.
